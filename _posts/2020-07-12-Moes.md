From all smarthome categories I feel like having a 'smart heating/cooling system' can be from all the one that saves up most money.

Having the heating going off when you are away from home and have it on when you are back (or before to be sure you get inside a warming house) or certain rooms at certain week days on or off, possibilities are endless..

In my apartment we have a Gas Boiler, 12 radiators and everything is controlled by a dumb BRAND Thermostat that's regulated by the temperature on the room is in (Living room).

My plans are to try to leave the default system as a fail guard and to build my own system using Home Assistant and Tasmota.

Thankfully [klausahrenberg](https://github.com/klausahrenberg) made this awesome custom firmware [WThermostatBeca](https://github.com/klausahrenberg/WThermostatBeca) that supports already a few of the thermostats.

I decided then to give it another go and ordered:
* [BHT-002-GCLW Black](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dWx7K6p) on AliExpress
* 3x [TRV Radiator Valves](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_BfjjwRMZ) on AliExpress
* [BHT-3000](https://amzn.to/3hacdOB) on Amazon.DE

Not by intension but it seems I have bought a lot of MOES devices, I didn't own any of they're products yet. But after opening the grey Gas Thermostat controller and the Radiator valves I'm very impressed with MOES, the case of the grey Thermostat is gorgeous I really love it and the manuals are totally in English and very easy to understand, I had no problems using or installing any of the devices.

## BHT-3000

Generally I prefer black and I have found some black controllers, but I didn't like one thing or the other. This one really looks gorgeous, even with some text or backlight blue it's not very intense and can easily blend in.

It's a Tuya WiFi device so the all the thrill if it has a esp8266 if it's going to work with tuya-converter if yes how easily will be integrated with Tasmota starts to grown on me from the moment it's in my hands. (If when I purchased the device there isn't much information easy available I try not to look to much to keep the excitement higher üôÉ)

Because Amazon didn't ship it to the Netherlands when I ordered I had to kindly ask two friends of mine that live in Germany if they could receive it for me, had to wait extra 4 days but still got it under a week. *Thank you Damian and Kasia* ‚ù§Ô∏è

On my (long) way home with the train I started analyzing the device, wow really looks gorgeous and not some cheap China looking the back cover is a metal plate that slides in and 4 little screws holding it together. 

<img src="/assets/img/bht3000_back.jpg" class="middlepic" height="65%" width="65%"/>

After taking out the back cover I could see a bit of the WiFi module but not enough to be sure of what it was and the lack of available tools made it was impossible to keep digging in so I decided to have a quick look though the manual. Very surprised and satisfied it was all in English.
And after that I decided to google more serious about the the BHT-3000 and see for example on the firmware I've found if someone else had tried.

Easily enough I found 2 open issues on the firmware github page where some users stated it they had it working nicely with the custom firmware and even had some nice pictures of the PCB inside from what I couldn't see before and there I could see the beautiful TYWE3SE module from Tuya.

Got home, connected my AC testing cable turned on tuya-converter and powered on the device putting it in 'EZ pair mode' pressing the down arrow for a few seconds awhile the screen was off and until the WiFi icon started blinking and started tuya-converter..

Not long after tuya-converter started backing up the device firmware, meaning flashing would also be possible OTA and decided to flash Tasmota right away and see. Successfully backed up the stock firmware and flashed Tasmota and after the initial configuration and setting the module to TuyaMCU I could clearly see A LOT of Tuya traffic on the Tasmota console which is understandable due to all the 'complexity' and functions of the device.

During my reading on the [WthermostatBeca github page I saw someone](https://github.com/klausahrenberg/WThermostatBeca/issues/98#issuecomment-617116444) saying it was possible to flash [WthermostatBeca](https://github.com/klausahrenberg/WThermostatBeca) OTA from Tasmota webpage using [Tasmota 7.2-minimal](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases/tag/v7.2.0) version and I also remembered seeing somewhere it had Home Assistant auto-discovery.

So instead of cracking down the Tuya messages and make end up losing a couple of hours making it possible to work with Tasmota I decided to [start downgrading my Tasmota versions to the 7.2minimal](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Upgrading/#migration-path) (I did try flashing only the latest minimal version and flash [WthermostatBeca](https://github.com/klausahrenberg/WThermostatBeca) but it failed) and from there I managed to successfully flash [WthermostatBeca](https://github.com/klausahrenberg/WThermostatBeca) OTA (I haven't got the device in practical use yet but few days on and its working flawlessly) got familiar with the interface whats what etc and then checked if Home Assistant auto-discovery had quick in and the device was already added since I didn't see any option related to that had to be automatic I thought.

No what happened during my googling is that I have found a [fork of Wthermostat](https://github.com/fashberg/WThermostatBeca) that indeed has Home Assistant auto-discovery.

Decided to give it ago aswell since I could see OTA option on the interface and downloaded the latest version, both minimal and normal and flashed the minimal initially and then the normal. Everything should be working normally but it wasn't 
There were some conflicts with the old firmware and mostly MQTT wasn't working properly. I decided to downgrade to the first minimal image and upgrade from there version by version. 
After the first downgrade I noticed MQTT was working normally again and when I flashed the latest version everything seemed to be working normally.

Tested a little bit more checked for the Home Assistant entity, it was there, a climate and a thermostat sensor, the response between MQTT and the device is very quick exactly what we'd expect from it.

Congratulations MOES, my first experience got me in love with you!

## TRV Radiators

Funny enough later that same day I had the 3 TRV radiator valves delivered from China the packaging wasn't so amusing but the quality and aesthetics are very similar to the BHT-3000. They are powered with 2 AA batteries and work with Zigbee 3.0 Tuya Gateway.  
Currently I am using [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) with CC2531 USB stick you can read more about my [Zigbee Adventure here ]()

My 3 radiator valves (it was all 1 order) came with some liquid/grease on the batteries top I made them not power until I cleaned them.

After cleaning the 3 units and powered them on I tried to pair them with my Zigbee gateway which was a success but they were added as Curtains Motor and can't seem to operate the device with it.

Few googling about the device and I found a issue on [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) github from someone having the same problem and offering a temporary (we hope) fix. 

I am waiting for a bunch more of Zigbee modules I pretend to do some other testings and create a zigbee environment for debug and testing without interfering with my established one andddddd I am also waiting for a Zigbee Curtains Rail motor that I believe has the same model id that's interfering with this.. 

More testing will be done once I receive more zigbee modules...

## BHT-002
Is one is coming on slow boat from China lets give it some slack...

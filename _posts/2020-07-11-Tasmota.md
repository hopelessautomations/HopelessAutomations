## ESP8266 

Awhile there are a lot of firmwares for ESP8266:
* [ESPEasy](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy) 
* [ESPurna](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna)
* [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)
* [Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/tasmota/)

[Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/tasmota/) is my favorite and go-to firmware whenever I need to play around with ESP8266, the community is great and full of knowledge and very inspiring.

I also use [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer) to serial flash my ESP's and [TasmoAdmin docker container](https://github.com/reloxx13/TasmoAdmin) to control and list all my Tasmota devices via webpage.

[Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/tasmota/)] Backlogs makes it extremely easy to configure devices entering just a couple of lines in the console, if I've flashed the device via serial I just a set of backlog messages and configure the device.

Otherwise if I flash the device OTA I need first to connect to the AP and configure my network and give it a nice hostname, then I can look into my Google WiFi app and see what IP address whats given and enter into the webpage console and from there I can continue configuring the device with my default backlog messages.

### Backlog messages
I have a txt file saved on my computer with a couple of backlog messages I use to configure my devices.

* If flashed via Serial my first message is to connect to my network and on the console I can see which IP was assign to it.
```
Backlog SSID1 YOUR_SSID; Password1 SSID_PASSWORD; SSID2 YOUR_SSID; Password2 SSID_PASSWORD; Hostname DEVICE_NAME
``` 
  
* Naming the Device (mutiple friendlyname exmple: Device Name: Charger, friendlyname1: SmartPhone, friendlyname2: SmartWatch)
```
Backlog DeviceName DEVICE_NAME; Topic DEVICE_NAME; MqttClient DEVICE_NAME; FriendlyName1 DEVICE_NAME
```
  
* To connect to my MQTT Broker I use
```
Backlog MqttHost MQTT_BROKER_IP; MqttUser MQTT_USER; MqttPassword MQTT_PASSWORD
```
  
* And I will add to one of the messages `module 18` for full ESP8266 pinout or `module 54` for Tuya devices
